Get the app working by doing the following:

Go to app folder

Start testrpc:
testrpc
copy/paste mneumonic into text editor

Migrate contracts:
truffle migrate

Start UI server:
npm start

When browser opens:
Lock, then re-open MetaMask with new mneumonic
Add two more accounts into MetaMask
Register for free tokens with the second and third accounts (refresh page after switching account)

If you have issues:
*  Ensure that if you're using MetaMask, you have the testrpc selected
*  When switching accounts in MetaMask, refresh page after switching account
*  If transactions still fail, try switching to another network, then switch back
